      <h2>The Rules</h2>
          <p>
          Baseball seems complicated compared to other sports, and it is. There are things super easy to understand, and then there are... other rules. 
          For this section, I'll just be going over the basic rules of baseball:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Positions
              <ul>
                <li>Infield: Catcher, 1st Baseman, 2nd Baseman, 3rd Baseman, Shortstop</li>
                <li>Outfield: Left Field, Center Field, Right Field</li>
                <li>Designated Hitter?</li>
               </ul>
             </li> 
            <li>Batting
              <ul>
                <li>The Pitcher: The pitcher is the guy you see throwing the ball to the batter, the person with a bat.</li>
                <li>Balls and Strikes: Strikes are simple, 3 and you're out. 4 balls is a walk, head to 1st base.</li>
                <li>Foul Balls: If the batter swings and hits the ball out of play (outside of foul lines, lines that run left and right of home plate), it is a foul, add one strike. If the batter is on 2 strikes, nothing happens, the at-bat continues.</li>
               </ul>
              </li>
             <li>Baserunning
              <ul>
                <li>The Bases: There is a large diamond shaped dirt path with bases on it. Starting at the bottom going counterclockwise, there is Home Plate, 1st Base, 2nd Base and 3rd Base. Heres a picture from MLB.com. <a href=http://m.mlb.com/glossary/rules/field-dimensions>Website</a></li>
                <li>If the batter puts a ball in play, they can run around the bases, going from home to 1st, 2nd, 3rd or maybe even home. Step on home to score a run. Team with the most runs after 9 innings (sets of 3 outs per team) wins.</li>
                <li>When you are standing on a base, you cannot be tagged out by the player with the ball.</li>
               </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            
          <h2>Recent History</h2>
            <p>
            Now that you (hopefully) have a basic idea of how to play baseball, let's go over some recent history. At the end of every season, there are awards given out
            to the players. The most coveted of them would be the league MVP and Cy Young award. The MVP award goes out to the overall best player from that league that
            season. The Cy Young goes to the best pitcher from the league that season. Then there is the World Series, the equivalent of the NBA finals or the Super Bowl.
            Heres another explanation from MLB.com <a href=https://www.mlb.com/awards>Website</a> Hope you learned something!
