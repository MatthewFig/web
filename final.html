         <h3>Project Description</h3>
         <p>
           This is a Python test made to function with the built in time module. It includes a custom set of random words I thought of, and a list of random sentences, many of them being quotes popularized by pop culture.

         <h3>Instructions</h3>
         <p>
           It's pretty simple. Run the program in Thonny, and instructions will be given. The user will have a choice between taking a test that measures how fast you can type three words. The second option tests how fast the user can type one random sentence.

         <h3>How it works</h3>
         <p>
           The display for text is pretty simple. Instructions are printed and the user is given the option to input their response. The time module begins as soon as the user confirms they are ready, and will return the time it took for the user to type all required items. If they spelled something wrong, a message saying that will be printed alongside the time it took. If the user types everything correctly, they will get a "good job" message alongside their time. It is important to note that punctuation and capitalization do matter, and some sentences are sentence fragments rather than acutal sentences.

         <h3>Bugs</h3>
           <p>
             I'd say that the program is relatively bug-free from my view. Only note would be that you must run the program to generate new words and sentences.
